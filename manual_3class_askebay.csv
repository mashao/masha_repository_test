'Neg*','@AskeBay Safari is the browser it WON''T work in. Firefox is the browser it WILL work in.'
'Neg','@AskeBay agents misquoted your buyer protection policy. Then told me the "system" wouldn''t let them file claim for me. Not great'
'Neutral','@AskeBay Out of curiosity, what if the buyer doesn''t reply to case ? how long before i can escalate ? case opened day 3 for non payment.'
'Pos','@AskeBay no thanks seems to be fixed now :)'
'Neg','@AskeBay yep the pages often freeze!'

'Neg*','@AskeBay I will try when I get out of work. I think it said there are long wait times.'
'Neg','@AskeBay Misleading to buyer when buyer is merely wanting to ask a question, Buyer knows how to open a case if  needed. Unfair to Seller!'
'Neg','@AskeBay Buyer knows how to open a case when necessary, doesn''t need to be mislead into opening a case. Arbitrary and unfair to Seller!'
'Neg','@AskeBay Not my account needing review. It''s my Seller who you banned. Will seek review though.'

'Neg*','@AskeBay hi, I sold an item which ended in bids. The buyer messaged me shortly after asking if I could cancel the transaction,' 
'Neg','@AskeBay what should I do in this situation? Seems like the buyer isn''t going to pay for the item, and I feel my time was wasted.'

'Neg','@AskeBay Well I think it''s just the battery. I get the black plugin icon inside the charging icon. I''ve tried multiple chargers but now'
'Neg','@AskeBay it seems to be working. It doesn''t get a full charge, even overnight, and the phone has been ordered a few months now.'
